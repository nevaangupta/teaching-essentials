		<h3>The items in the Teachers' Essential Kit items are things needed in a classroom by most teachers. The items included in the kit have been selected to teach without interruption. This will come in handy for when a teacher runs out of a specific item needed to teach in the middle of a class or if a student requests a teacher for an item that he or she may need.  The benefit of Teachers' Essential Kit is that teachers do not have to go search for separate items when getting ready for the school year, and do not have to worry about forgetting something for a class because they can just bring the kit. The Teachers' Essential Kit is a teachers’ toolkit that they can rely on for regular teaching. </h3>
